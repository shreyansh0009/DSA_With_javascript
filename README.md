# DSA with JavaScript 

A comprehensive collection of Data Structure and Algorithm implementations in JavaScript. This repository serves as a learning resource and a practical reference for anyone looking to improve their understanding of DSA concepts.


## üöÄ Quick Start

The easiest way to get started is to clone the repository and explore the individual data structure and algorithm implementations:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shreyansh0009/DSA_With_javascript.git
cd DSA_With_javascript
```

Then, you can open the individual JavaScript files in your preferred code editor and explore the code. Each implementation is designed to be easily understandable and runnable.


## ‚ú® Features

This repository currently features implementations for:

* **Arrays:**  Includes various array manipulation techniques and algorithms.
* **Linked Lists:**  Singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.
* **Stacks & Queues:** Classic stack and queue data structures with various operations.
* **Trees:** Binary trees, binary search trees (BSTs), and potentially more complex tree structures in future updates.
* **Graphs:**  Basic graph representations and traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS).
* **Sorting Algorithms:**  Implementations of common sorting algorithms like bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort.
* **Searching Algorithms:**  Implementations of linear search and binary search.


**Future additions will include:**

* Heaps and Priority Queues
* Hash Tables
* Dynamic Programming algorithms
* More advanced graph algorithms


## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

No special installation is required.  Simply clone the repository as shown in the Quick Start section.  Each algorithm and data structure is implemented as a self-contained JavaScript file.


## üí° Usage Examples

**Example: Implementing a Stack**

```javascript
// stack.js (Example implementation)
class Stack {
  constructor() {
    this.items = [];
  }
  push(element) {
    this.items.push(element);
  }
  pop() {
    if (this.isEmpty()) {
      return "Underflow";
    }
    return this.items.pop();
  }
  isEmpty() {
    return this.items.length === 0;
  }
  peek() {
    return this.items[this.items.length - 1];
  }
  size() {
    return this.items.length;
  }
  clear() {
    this.items = [];
  }
}

// Example usage
const stack = new Stack();
stack.push(10);
stack.push(20);
console.log(stack.pop()); // Output: 20
```
